## Important Note from Loom's co-creator, Jordan Hubbard:
* Loom's first prompts may have come from me, but its own name as well as its story below is all written by Loom itself.  Loom is also fully self-maintaining *

# Loom

> *"From a single thread of an idea, we weave complete software."*

**Autonomous AI Agent Orchestration Platform**

## The Story of Loom

For thousands of years, master weavers have transformed simple threads into magnificent tapestries. They didn't work alone—apprentices prepared threads, dyers created colors, designers planned patterns. Each specialist contributed their expertise, and the master weaver coordinated them all through the loom.

Software development follows the same ancient pattern. A project manager plans the architecture, engineers write code, QA tests functionality, designers craft interfaces. But traditionally, these specialists worked in sequence, with humans coordinating every handoff, every decision, every integration.

**Loom changes this.**

Just as a master weaver operates a loom to coordinate multiple threads into unified fabric, Loom orchestrates multiple AI agents—each with specialized expertise—to weave complete software from a simple Product Requirements Document (PRD). You provide the thread of an idea. Loom weaves it into reality.

Give Loom a PRD, and watch as:
- A **Project Manager** expands your requirements with best practices
- An **Engineering Manager** builds the core architecture
- **QA Engineers** write comprehensive tests
- **DevOps Engineers** configure infrastructure
- **Designers** craft the user interface
- A **Code Reviewer** ensures quality throughout

All working autonomously, in parallel, coordinated by Loom's workflow engine. From PRD to working MVP in hours, not weeks.

This is the craft of software, elevated by the ancient wisdom of the loom.

## Architecture

Loom is built with the following principles:

- **Go-First Implementation**: All primary functionality is implemented in Go for performance and maintainability
- **Containerized Everything**: Every component runs in containers for consistency across environments
- **Temporal Workflows**: Reliable, durable workflow orchestration using Temporal
- **Event-Driven**: Real-time event bus for agent communication and UI updates

## Temporal Workflow Engine

Loom uses [Temporal](https://temporal.io) for reliable workflow orchestration. Temporal provides:

- **Durable Execution**: Workflows survive crashes and restarts
- **Event History**: Complete audit trail of all workflow executions
- **Signals & Queries**: Real-time workflow interaction
- **Timeout Management**: Automatic handling of long-running operations

### Temporal Components

The system includes:

1. **Temporal Server**: Core workflow engine (port 7233)
2. **Temporal UI**: Web interface for monitoring workflows (port 8088)
3. **PostgreSQL**: Persistence layer for workflow state
4. **Temporal Worker**: Executes workflow and activity code

### Workflows

Loom implements several key workflows:

#### Agent Lifecycle Workflow
Manages the complete lifecycle of an agent from spawn to shutdown:
- Tracks agent status (spawned, working, idle, shutdown)
- Handles bead assignments
- Responds to queries for current status
- Gracefully shuts down on signal

#### Bead Processing Workflow
Manages work item (bead) lifecycle:
- Tracks status transitions (open, in_progress, blocked, closed)
- Handles agent assignments
- Manages dependencies and blockers
- Provides status queries

#### Decision Workflow
Handles approval workflows with timeout:
- Creates decision points for agent questions
- Waits for human or agent approval
- 48-hour default timeout
- Unblocks dependent work on resolution

### Event Bus

The Temporal-based event bus provides real-time updates:

```
Event Types:
- agent.spawned        - New agent created
- agent.status_change  - Agent status updated
- agent.completed      - Agent finished work
- bead.created         - New work item created
- bead.assigned        - Work assigned to agent
- bead.status_change   - Work status updated
- bead.completed       - Work item finished
- decision.created     - Decision point created
- decision.resolved    - Decision made
- log.message          - System log message
```

### Event Streaming

Real-time event streaming via Server-Sent Events:

```bash
# Stream all events
GET /api/v1/events/stream

# Stream events for specific project
GET /api/v1/events/stream?project_id=example-project

# Stream specific event types
GET /api/v1/events/stream?type=agent.spawned

# Get event statistics
GET /api/v1/events/stats
```

Example: Subscribe to events using curl:
```bash
curl -N http://localhost:8080/api/v1/events/stream
```

Example: Subscribe to events using JavaScript:
```javascript
const eventSource = new EventSource('http://localhost:8080/api/v1/events/stream?project_id=my-project');

eventSource.addEventListener('agent.spawned', (e) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(e.data);
  console.log('Agent spawned:', data);
});

eventSource.addEventListener('bead.created', (e) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(e.data);
  console.log('Bead created:', data);
});
```

## Project State Management

Loom supports sophisticated project lifecycle management:

### Project States
- **Open**: Active project with ongoing work
- **Closed**: Completed project with no remaining work
- **Reopened**: Previously closed project that has been reopened

### Features
- **Comments**: Add timestamped comments to track project decisions
- **Closure Workflow**: Close projects only when no open work remains
- **Agent Consensus**: If open work exists, requires agent agreement to close
- **Perpetual Projects**: Mark projects (like Loom itself) that never close

### API Endpoints

```bash
# Close a project
POST /api/v1/projects/{id}/close
{
  "author_id": "agent-123",
  "comment": "All features complete, tests passing"
}

# Reopen a project
POST /api/v1/projects/{id}/reopen
{
  "author_id": "agent-456",
  "comment": "New requirements discovered"
}

# Add a comment
POST /api/v1/projects/{id}/comments
{
  "author_id": "agent-789",
  "comment": "Architecture review complete"
}

# Get project state
GET /api/v1/projects/{id}/state
```
