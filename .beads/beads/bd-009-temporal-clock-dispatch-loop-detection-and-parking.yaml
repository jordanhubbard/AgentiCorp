title: P0 - Temporal-controlled clock for dispatch, loop detection, and AgentiCorp parked/active state
description: |
  Implement a Temporal-driven "clock" (durable scheduler) that ensures AgentiCorp
  continuously and reliably dispatches agents to their assigned beads, reacts to
  asynchronous work submissions, detects looping/deadlock behavior, and exposes
  a visible "parked" state when there is no work.

  Goals
  - AgentiCorp wakes up on a schedule and on signals/events to:
    - dispatch agents to beads assigned to them
    - re-dispatch beads handed back by agents
    - detect work loops / deadlocks and route appropriately
  - If ALL beads in ALL open projects are closed, AgentiCorp transitions to
    status: parked (visible in UI for the CEO).
  - Any newly filed bead, or any agent waking and discovering new work,
    transitions AgentiCorp out of parked state.

  Requirements
  1) Temporal-controlled clock
     - Use Temporal to run a long-lived workflow (e.g., agenticorp-clock) that
       performs periodic polling/dispatch (and uses continue-as-new).
     - Workflow must also accept signals for:
       - bead.created / bead.updated
       - agent.heartbeat / agent.woke
       - bead.returned_for_redispatch
     - The clock triggers AgentiCorp dispatch logic deterministically and reliably.

  2) Guaranteed dispatch / redispatch
     - If a bead is assigned_to an agent, AgentiCorp must ensure that agent is
       scheduled/started and picks up the bead (or is marked unhealthy).
     - If an agent hands a bead back to AgentiCorp for redispatch, AgentiCorp must
       wake and take action.

  3) Loop / deadlock detection
     - Detect beads being handed back and forth between the same agents with
       repeating/near-repeating comments (initial heuristic is acceptable).
     - On loop detection:
       - Reassign bead to project-manager persona by default
       - If PM is one of the looping agents, escalate to CEO (bd-008)
       - Record rationale in bead context/comments.

  4) Parked/active status surfaced in UI
     - Add AgentiCorp system status (active|parked) to UI/API.
     - When parked, CEO can see that AgentiCorp is idle.
     - Any new work event flips status back to active.

  Suggested Implementation
  - Add a new Temporal workflow: AgentiCorpClockWorkflow
    - Runs periodic tick (e.g., every 30s)
    - Exposes signals for asynchronous triggers
    - On each tick or signal:
      - scan open projects
      - compute open-work set (non-closed beads)
      - update agenticorp status parked/active
      - run dispatch and loop detection actions
  - Add a small system-status store (in-memory + optional persistence) and API:
    - GET /api/v1/system/status
  - Add UI widget in header to show status.

  Acceptance Criteria
  - AgentiCorp reliably dispatches assigned beads without manual intervention.
  - Redispatch occurs promptly when bead is returned.
  - Looping beads are detected and reassigned/escalated.
  - AgentiCorp shows parked state in UI when no open work exists.
  - Any new bead/event transitions AgentiCorp to active and dispatch resumes.
