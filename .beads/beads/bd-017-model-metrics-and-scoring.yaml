title: P2 - Provider/model metrics + dynamic scoring (availability/latency/throughput)
description: |
    Add runtime metrics and a dynamic scoring system to rank provider-model
    candidates.

    Metrics
    - Track per-provider/per-model rolling metrics:
      - success/error rate
      - latency (TTFB if available; otherwise total duration)
      - throughput (tokens/sec when measurable)
      - last_seen_at
    - Persist aggregated metrics in config DB (schema TBD).

    Scoring
    - Compute a score combining:
      - availability/health
      - latency (lower is better)
      - throughput (higher is better)
      - future: dollar cost
    - Expose score in provider state and API responses.

    Instrumentation
    - Capture timing around provider chat completion calls.
    - Update rolling metrics upon each request.

    Acceptance Criteria
    - Scores exist and update over time based on real request data.
    - Provider negotiation uses the score when ranking models.
    - Scores/metrics are visible via API.
