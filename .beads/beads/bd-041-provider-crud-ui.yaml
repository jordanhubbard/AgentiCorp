title: P0 - Provider CRUD UI Not Working
description: |
  The "Register Provider" button in the web UI does not appear to function.
  Clicking it produces no visible response - no modal appears.

  Investigation Findings
  - Backend API works: POST /api/v1/providers successfully creates providers via curl
  - JavaScript function showRegisterProviderModal() exists and looks correct
  - formModal() function exists and returns a Promise
  - openAppModal() function exists and sets modal display to 'block'
  - Modal HTML element #app-modal exists with correct structure
  - CSS has .modal { display: none } which should be overridden by JS

  Possible Causes
  1. JavaScript error preventing execution (check browser console)
  2. Modal CSS override preventing visibility
  3. Event handler not properly attached to button
  4. formModal Promise chain issue

  Required Functionality
  Provider CRUD operations needed:
  - [x] POST /api/v1/providers - Create provider (API works)
  - [x] GET /api/v1/providers - List providers (API works)
  - [ ] GET /api/v1/providers/{id} - Get single provider
  - [ ] PUT /api/v1/providers/{id} - Update provider
  - [ ] DELETE /api/v1/providers/{id} - Delete provider
  - [ ] UI: Register provider modal (currently broken)
  - [ ] UI: Edit provider modal
  - [ ] UI: Delete provider confirmation
  - [ ] UI: Provider status display (pending/active/error)
  - [ ] UI: Test provider connectivity button

  Acceptance Criteria
  - [ ] "Register Provider" button opens modal form
  - [ ] Modal form submits and creates provider via API
  - [ ] Provider list updates after registration
  - [ ] Success/error toast displayed appropriately
  - [ ] Edit and Delete buttons work for existing providers
  - [ ] Provider status is visible and updated

  Debug Steps
  1. Open browser developer console (F12)
  2. Click "Register Provider" button
  3. Check for JavaScript errors
  4. Inspect #app-modal element for style changes

  rationale: |
    Without working provider registration, users cannot add AI providers
    to the system. This blocks the ability to activate paused agents and
    prevents any actual AI work from being performed. Critical path blocker.
