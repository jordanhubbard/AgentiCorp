title: P1 - Deduplicate Makefile targets (build/run/test/clean/docker-build/help)
description: |
  Resolve duplicate Makefile targets that emit override warnings when running
  make build/run/test/clean/docker-build/help.

  Context
  - make build warns about duplicate target definitions at lines 79 and 23.
  - make run warns about duplicate target definitions at lines 92 and 28.
  - make test warns about duplicate target definitions at lines 96 and 33.
  - make clean warns about duplicate target definitions at lines 118 and 44.
  - make docker-build warns about duplicate target definitions at lines 145 and 50.
  - make help warns about duplicate target definitions at lines 148 and 5.

  Requirements
  - Remove or consolidate duplicate targets so each target is defined once.
  - Preserve current behavior of each target (build/run/test/clean/docker-build/help).
  - Ensure `make build`, `make run`, `make test`, `make clean`, `make docker-build`, and `make help`
    run without override warnings.

  Acceptance Criteria
  - No override warnings when invoking any of the listed targets.
  - Target behavior remains consistent with the intended latest definitions.
