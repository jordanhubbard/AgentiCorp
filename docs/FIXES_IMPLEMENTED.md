# Loom Work Flow Fixes - Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the critical fixes implemented to resolve the "no work flowing through Loom" issue.

## Implementation Date
2026-02-02

## Problem Statement
The Loom system was not generating any work - no beads were being processed, no code changes were being generated, and agents were not executing tasks. This indicated critical blockages in the work flow pipeline.

## Fixes Implemented

### ✅ Fix #2: Activate Providers on Startup (CRITICAL)
**File:** `internal/loom/loom.go` (lines 567-591)

**Problem:** Providers were defaulting to "pending" status, causing the dispatcher to park immediately with "no active providers registered".

**Solution:** Added automatic activation of all enabled providers during system initialization. The code now:
- Iterates through all loaded providers
- Activates any with "pending" or empty status
- Updates both database and in-memory registry
- Logs activation results

**Impact:** This was the most critical fix - without active providers, the dispatcher would never dispatch work.

---

### ✅ Fix #3: Add Temporal Failure Fallback (CRITICAL)
**File:** `cmd/loom/main.go` (lines 104-127)

**Problem:** If Temporal was configured but the server wasn't running, the fallback dispatch loop wouldn't start, causing zero dispatch activity.

**Solution:** Replaced conditional dispatch loop with an always-running fallback that:
- Runs every 10 seconds regardless of Temporal configuration
- Checks if Temporal manager exists
- Uses fallback dispatch when Temporal is not configured
- Ensures work continues even if Temporal fails

**Impact:** Prevents total system stall when Temporal configuration exists but server is unavailable.

---

### ✅ Fix #5: Reset Stuck Agents (HIGH)
**Files:**
- `internal/agent/worker_manager.go` (lines 594-637) - Added ResetStuckAgents method
- `internal/loom/loom.go` (lines 2699-2703) - Added call in maintenance loop

**Problem:** Agents stuck in "working" state for too long, or paused agents with providers, couldn't be dispatched to.

**Solution:** Added `ResetStuckAgents()` method that:
- Runs every minute in the maintenance loop
- Resets agents in "working" state for more than 5 minutes
- Restores paused agents that have providers assigned
- Persists changes to database
- Publishes agent reset events

**Impact:** Automatically recovers agents that get stuck, restoring system capacity.

---

### ✅ Fix #1: Start Motivation Engine (HIGH)
**File:** `internal/loom/loom.go` (lines 687-697)

**Problem:** The motivation engine was created and default motivations were registered, but `engine.Start(ctx)` was never called, so no automatic bead creation occurred.

**Solution:** Added explicit call to `motivationEngine.Start(ctx)` after registering default motivations, with:
- Error logging if start fails
- Success confirmation logging
- Warning if engine not initialized

**Impact:** Enables automatic bead creation from idle detection, deadline monitoring, budget thresholds, etc.

---

### ✅ Fix #4: Validate Projects and Create Sample Bead (MEDIUM)
**File:** `internal/loom/loom.go` (lines 699-727)

**Problem:** If no projects had beads, there would be nothing for the dispatcher to work on.

**Solution:** Added validation logic that:
- Checks all projects for existing beads
- Creates a diagnostic bead if none exist
- Logs project/bead status
- Provides clear feedback about system readiness

**Impact:** Provides diagnostic aid and ensures there's always work available for testing.

---

### ✅ Fix #7: Add Error Logging for Silent Failures (MEDIUM)
**File:** `internal/dispatch/dispatcher.go` (multiple locations)

**Problem:** Database and event bus failures were silently discarded with `_ =` patterns, making debugging impossible.

**Solution:** Replaced all `_ =` error suppressions with proper logging:

1. **Line 504-521:** Agent bead assignment and event publishing
   - Logs CRITICAL error if AssignBead fails
   - Logs warnings for event bus failures

2. **Line 566-578:** Bead context/loop detection updates
   - Logs CRITICAL error if UpdateBead fails
   - Logs warnings for event publishing failures

3. **Line 621-633:** Bead updates after task failure
   - Logs CRITICAL error if UpdateBead fails
   - Logs warnings for event publishing failures

**Impact:** Improves debugging by surfacing hidden failures that could corrupt system state.

## Files Modified

1. **internal/loom/loom.go**
   - Provider activation logic (Fix #2)
   - Motivation engine start (Fix #1)
   - Project/bead validation (Fix #4)
   - Maintenance loop agent reset (Fix #5)

2. **cmd/loom/main.go**
   - Temporal fallback dispatch loop (Fix #3)

3. **internal/agent/worker_manager.go**
   - ResetStuckAgents method (Fix #5)

4. **internal/dispatch/dispatcher.go**
   - Error logging for silent failures (Fix #7)

## Verification Steps

After these fixes, the system should show:

1. **Dispatcher Status:** "active" (not "parked")
2. **Active Providers:** At least 1 provider with status "active"
3. **Idle Agents:** At least 1 agent with status "idle" and assigned provider
4. **Dispatch Activity:** Logs show dispatch attempts every 10 seconds
5. **Motivation Engine:** Running and evaluating conditions
6. **Error Visibility:** Failed database/event operations now logged

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Start the server** and check logs for:
   - "Successfully activated N providers"
   - "Motivation engine started successfully"
   - "Found existing beads across projects" or "Created sample diagnostic bead"

2. **Check system status:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/system/status
   ```
   Should return `"state": "active"`

3. **Verify providers active:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/providers | jq '.[] | {id, status}'
   ```
   Should show at least one with `"status": "active"`

4. **Monitor dispatch activity:**
   ```bash
   tail -f loom.log | grep -E "(Dispatch|Motivation|Agent)"
   ```
   Should see regular dispatch attempts

5. **Create a test bead** and verify it gets picked up:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/beads \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"title": "Test", "project_id": "loom", "description": "Test dispatch", "priority": 2, "type": "task"}'
   ```

## Expected Outcomes

✅ Dispatcher Status: "active" (not "parked")
✅ Active Providers: At least 1 provider with status "active"
✅ Idle Agents: At least 1 agent with status "idle" and assigned provider
✅ Loaded Beads: At least 1 bead with status "open" or "in_progress"
✅ Dispatch Activity: Logs show regular dispatch attempts
✅ Agent Execution: Agents execute tasks and return results
✅ Motivation Engine: Evaluates conditions automatically
✅ Work Flow: End-to-end bead creation → dispatch → execution → completion

## Notes

- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- No database migrations required
- Changes are defensive - they log warnings but don't break functionality
- The diagnostic bead creation is a one-time operation at startup if no beads exist
- Agent reset runs every minute but only affects genuinely stuck agents (>5 minutes working)

## Compilation Status

✅ Code compiles successfully with no errors
