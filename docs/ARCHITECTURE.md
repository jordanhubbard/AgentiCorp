## Core Components

### 1. Agent System

**Purpose**: Manage autonomous AI agents with role-based personas

**Key Files**: 
- `internal/loom/worker_manager.go`
- `internal/models/agent.go`

**Concepts**:
- **Agent**: An autonomous actor with a defined role and persona
- **Persona**: Instructions, guidelines, and behavioral rules for an agent
- **Status**: `idle`, `working`, `paused`, `complete`
- **Role**: Org chart position (CEO, CFO, Engineer, etc.)

**Workflow**:
1. Agents are created from personas on project assignment
2. Agents remain paused until a provider becomes available
3. When providers are healthy, agents resume and can accept work
4. Agents process beads, make decisions, request escalations

**Database**: `agents` table with status, role, and capability tracking

### 2. Bead System (Work Items)

**Purpose**: Define and track discrete units of work in the system

**Key Files**:
- `internal/models/bead.go`
- `docs/BEADS_WORKFLOW.md`

**Concepts**:
- **Bead**: A JSONL-defined work item managed by the `bd` CLI
- **Status**: `open`, `in_progress`, `done`, `blocked`
- **Type**: Describes the work (feature, bugfix, test, decision, etc.)
- **Dependencies**: `blocked_by`, `blocks`, `parent`, `children`

**Workflow**:
1. Beads are stored in `.beads/issues.jsonl` (managed by `bd`)
2. Each bead has a unique ID and metadata
3. Beads are loaded at startup and on project changes
4. Agents process ready beads (no blocking dependencies)
5. Completion updates the work graph in real-time

**Database**: `beads` table with status, priority, and dependency tracking

### 3. Provider System

**Purpose**: Interface with external LLM providers with intelligent routing and cost optimization

**Key Files**:
- `pkg/provider/provider.go`
- `internal/models/provider.go`
- `internal/routing/router.go` (NEW v1.0)
- `internal/loom/loom.go` (provider management)

**Concepts**:
- **Provider**: An external LLM service (local or cloud)
- **Endpoint**: Network address for provider communication
- **Model**: LLM served by the provider (e.g., Nemotron, GPT-4)
- **Status**: `pending`, `active`, `error`
- **Cost Metadata** (NEW v1.0): Cost per million tokens for optimization
- **Capabilities** (NEW v1.0): Context window, function calling, vision support
- **Routing Policy** (NEW v1.0): Selection strategy (cost, latency, quality, balanced)

**Workflow**:
1. Providers are registered via UI with endpoint, model, and cost info
2. Immediate health check validates provider availability
3. Provider heartbeat workflow monitors health (30s interval)
4. On status change, agents resume or pause accordingly
5. **Router selects optimal provider** based on policy and requirements (NEW v1.0)
6. Automatic failover if selected provider fails

**Database**: `providers` table with endpoint, status, cost, capabilities, and heartbeat tracking

**Provider Requirements**:
- `MaxCostPerMToken`: Maximum acceptable cost
- `MaxLatencyMs`: Maximum acceptable latency
- `MinContextWindow`: Minimum context window size
- `RequiresFunction`: Must support function calling
- `RequiresVision`: Must support vision/multimodal
- `RequiredTags`: Custom capability tags

**Automatic Failover**:

- `internal/motivation/defaults.go` - 34 built-in motivations for 12 agent roles
- `internal/api/handlers_motivations.go` - REST API endpoints
- `internal/api/handlers_webhooks.go` - GitHub webhook integration

**Concepts**:
- **Motivation**: A trigger that can wake an agent or create work
- **Evaluator**: Logic to determine when a motivation should fire
- **Cooldown**: Minimum time between triggers to prevent storms
- **Stimulus Bead**: Work item automatically created when motivation fires

**Motivation Types**:

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `calendar` | Time-based triggers | Deadline approaching, quarter boundary, scheduled interval |
| `event` | System event triggers | Bead completed, decision pending, release published |
| `threshold` | Metric-based triggers | Cost exceeded, coverage dropped, test failure |
| `idle` | Activity-based triggers | System idle, project idle, agent idle |
| `external` | Webhook triggers | GitHub issue opened, PR opened, comment added |

**Default Motivations by Role**:
- **CEO**: System idle → strategic review, Decision pending → executive approval
- **CFO**: Budget exceeded → cost analysis, Monthly review
- **Project Manager**: Deadline approaching/passed, Velocity drop
- **Engineering Manager**: Test failure, Coverage drop
- **QA Engineer**: Bead completed → review, Test failure → investigation
- **DevOps Engineer**: Release approaching → infrastructure prep
- **And 6 more roles...**

**Workflow**:
1. Motivation engine evaluates all registered motivations on heartbeat (30s)
2. Each evaluator checks its condition against current system state
3. If condition met and cooldown elapsed, motivation fires
4. Fire actions: wake agent, create stimulus bead, publish event
5. Cooldown period prevents re-triggering until elapsed

**API Endpoints**:
- `GET /api/v1/motivations` - List motivations with filters
- `POST /api/v1/motivations/{id}/enable` - Enable motivation
- `POST /api/v1/motivations/{id}/disable` - Disable motivation

**Architecture**:
```
EventBus → ActivityManager → NotificationManager → User SSE Streams
   ↓            ↓                    ↓
[Events]  [activity_feed]    [notifications]
```

**Activity Manager**:
- Subscribes to EventBus and filters ~15 important event types
- Transforms events into activities with resource metadata
- Implements time-window aggregation (5-minute windows)
- Persists activities to database with project-based permissions
- Broadcasts to SSE subscribers in real-time

**Notification Manager**:
- Subscribes to activity stream
- Applies notification rules per user:
  - Direct assignments (beads, decisions)
  - Critical priority alerts (P0 beads)
  - System errors (provider/workflow failures)
- Respects user preferences (quiet hours, priority thresholds)
- Creates user-specific notifications
- Streams to authenticated users via SSE

**Event Filtering**:
- ✅ Persisted: `bead.*`, `agent.*`, `project.*`, `provider.*`, `decision.*`, `motivation.*`, `workflow.*`
- ❌ Filtered: `agent.heartbeat`, `log.message`, `system.idle` (too noisy)

**Aggregation Logic**:
- Groups similar events within 5-minute windows
- Aggregation key: `{event_type}.{date-hour}.{project_id}.{actor_id}`
- Example: 5 bead creations → single activity with `aggregation_count: 5`
- In-memory cache with database fallback

**API Endpoints**:

- `POST /api/v1/notifications/{id}/read` - Mark as read
- `POST /api/v1/notifications/mark-all-read` - Bulk mark read
- `GET /api/v1/notifications/preferences` - Get user preferences
- `PATCH /api/v1/notifications/preferences` - Update preferences

**Database Tables**:
- `users` - User information for notifications (migrated from in-memory auth)
- `activity_feed` - All activities with aggregation support
- `notifications` - User-specific notifications (status, priority)
- `notification_preferences` - Per-user configuration (events, quiet hours, thresholds)

**Permission Filtering**: Users only see activities from projects they have `projects:read` access to, plus global activities (providers, system events)

See [docs/activity-notifications-implementation.md](activity-notifications-implementation.md) for complete reference.

    endpoint: http://localhost:8000
    model: nvidia/Nemotron
```

## Deployment

### Local Development

```bash
# Start full stack with Docker
docker compose up -d

# Or run locally with external Temporal
make run
```

### Docker Deployment

- Loom container on port 8080
- Temporal server on port 7233
- Temporal UI on port 8088
- PostgreSQL for Temporal state

## State Persistence

All state is persisted to:
1. **SQLite Database**: Core application state
2. **Temporal Server**: Workflow execution state
3. **Bead JSONL Files**: Work item definitions (`.beads/issues.jsonl`)

State survives container restarts. Clean with:

```bash
make distclean  # Wipes database and Temporal state
```

## Extensions

Loom can be extended via:

1. **Custom Personas**: Add new agent roles in `personas/`
2. **Custom Beads**: Define work items in project `.beads/` directories
3. **Temporal Workflows**: Add workflows in `internal/temporal/workflows/`
4. **Custom Providers**: Register new LLM endpoints
5. **Temporal DSL**: Use DSL in agent instructions for workflows
6. **Custom Motivations**: Register custom triggers via API or DSL
7. **External Webhooks**: Configure GitHub or custom webhook triggers

See individual documentation files for details.
