# Loom User Guide

This guide helps new users run Loom, register projects, and work with agents and beads.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker 20.10+
- Docker Compose 1.29+
- Go 1.24+ (optional for local development)

### Start Loom

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

For local development with the full container stack, you can also use:

```bash
make run
```

Once running, Loom serves the API on `:8080` and the Temporal UI on `:8088`.

## Project Registration

Projects are registered in `config.yaml` under `projects:`. Required fields:

- `id`
- `name`
- `git_repo`
- `branch`
- `beads_path`

Optional fields:

- `is_perpetual` (never closes)
- `is_sticky` (auto-registered on startup)
- `context` (build/test/lint commands and other agent guidance)
- `git_auth_method` (e.g., `ssh`)
- `git_credential_id` (if using managed credentials)

Example:

```yaml
projects:
  - id: loom
    name: Loom
    git_repo: git@github.com:jordanhubbard/loom.git
    branch: main
    beads_path: .beads
    git_auth_method: ssh
    is_perpetual: true
    is_sticky: true
    context:
      build_command: "make build"
      test_command: "make test"
```

Loom loads beads from each project’s `beads_path` and uses them to build the work graph.

### Git Access (SSH Keys)

For SSH-based repos, fetch the per-project public key and add it as a **write-enabled deploy key**:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/projects/<project-id>/git-key
```

Dispatch will pause until git access and the beads path are valid.

## Personas and Agents

Default personas live under `personas/default/`. The system persona(s) live under
`personas/loom/`.

Agents are created from personas and attached to projects. The Project Viewer UI
shows agent assignments and bead progress in real time.

## Beads

Beads are JSONL work items stored in `.beads/issues.jsonl` for each project and
managed by the `bd` CLI. They drive the work graph and include metadata such as
priority, status, and dependencies.

Key fields:

- `id`, `type`, `title`, `description`
- `status`, `priority`, `project_id`
- `assigned_to`, `blocked_by`, `blocks`, `parent`, `children`

## Operational Workflow

1. Register projects in `config.yaml`.
2. Start Loom (docker compose or binary).
3. Confirm beads are loaded in the UI and API.
4. Assign agents to projects and monitor progress.
5. Use decisions/approvals for escalations (e.g., CEO workflow).

## Testing

Loom’s default `make test` runs the full Docker stack with Temporal:

```bash
make test
```

## Project Management UI

The Projects section and Project Viewer both support CRUD operations:

- **Add Project**: create a new project with repo, branch, and beads path.
- **Edit Project**: update fields like branch, beads path, perpetual/sticky flags.
- **Delete Project**: remove a project and its assignments.

Changes are applied immediately and reflected across the UI.

## CEO REPL

The CEO REPL lets you send high-priority questions directly to Loom. It uses
Temporal to route the request through the best available provider (quality and
latency weighted) with the Loom persona context.

1. Navigate to the **CEO REPL** section.
2. Enter your question and click **Send**.
3. Review the response and provider/model metadata.

## Activity Feed and Notifications

Loom provides a comprehensive activity tracking and notification system to keep teams informed about important events.

### Activity Feed

The activity feed shows all important events across your projects, including bead creation, agent assignments, project updates, and more.

**Access the activity feed:**

```bash
# Get recent activities (paginated)
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/activity-feed

# Filter by project
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/activity-feed?project_id=loom

# Filter by event type
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/activity-feed?event_type=bead.created

# Get only aggregated activities
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/activity-feed?aggregated=true

# Stream activities in real-time (SSE)
curl -N http://localhost:8080/api/v1/activity-feed/stream
```

**Activity aggregation**: Similar activities within a 5-minute window are automatically grouped. For example, if an agent creates 5 beads in 3 minutes, you'll see a single activity with `aggregation_count: 5` instead of 5 separate entries.

### Notifications

Notifications are user-specific alerts for important events that require your attention.

**Get your notifications:**

```bash
# Login to get token
TOKEN=$(curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"admin"}' | jq -r .token)

# Get all notifications
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8080/api/v1/notifications

# Get only unread notifications
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8080/api/v1/notifications?status=unread

# Stream notifications in real-time (SSE)
curl -N -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8080/api/v1/notifications/stream
```

**Mark notifications as read:**

```bash
# Mark single notification as read
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8080/api/v1/notifications/{id}/read

# Mark all as read
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8080/api/v1/notifications/mark-all-read
```

### Notification Rules

You'll automatically receive notifications for:

1. **Direct Assignments**: When a bead or decision is assigned to you
2. **Critical Priority**: When a P0 (critical) bead is created
3. **Decision Required**: When a decision requires your input
4. **System Alerts**: Provider failures, workflow errors, and other critical system events

### Notification Preferences

Configure your notification preferences to control what you receive:

```bash
# Get current preferences
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8080/api/v1/notifications/preferences

# Update preferences
curl -X PATCH -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "enable_in_app": true,
    "subscribed_events": ["bead.assigned", "decision.created"],
    "min_priority": "high",
    "quiet_hours_start": "22:00",
    "quiet_hours_end": "08:00"
  }' \
  http://localhost:8080/api/v1/notifications/preferences
```

**Preference options:**

- `enable_in_app`: Enable/disable in-app notifications (default: true)
- `subscribed_events`: List of event types to receive (empty = all events)
- `min_priority`: Minimum priority level (low, normal, high, critical)
- `quiet_hours_start/end`: Time range to suppress notifications (24-hour format)
- `digest_mode`: Delivery mode (realtime, hourly, daily)
- `project_filters`: Only receive notifications from specific projects

For complete API documentation and technical details, see [docs/activity-notifications-implementation.md](activity-notifications-implementation.md).

## Configuration

Loom is configured via `config.yaml`. Key sections include:

### Dispatch Configuration

```yaml
dispatch:
  max_hops: 20  # Maximum times a bead can be redispatched before escalation
```

**Dispatch Hop Limit**: When a bead is dispatched (assigned to an agent) more than `max_hops` times without being closed, it is automatically escalated to P0 priority and a CEO decision bead is created. This prevents infinite redispatch loops while allowing complex investigations to proceed (default: 20, previously 5). See [DISPATCH_CONFIG.md](DISPATCH_CONFIG.md) for detailed configuration guidance.

The system automatically enables redispatch for open and in-progress beads, allowing them to be picked up by idle agents. Dispatch history is tracked in the bead's context.

### Other Configuration Sections

- `agents`: Agent concurrency, personas, heartbeat intervals
- `beads`: Bead CLI path, auto-sync settings
- `security`: Authentication, CORS, PKI settings
- `temporal`: Workflow orchestration connection

See `config.yaml` for full configuration options.

## Troubleshooting

- If beads fail to load, confirm `.beads/issues.jsonl` exists and `bd list` works.
- If providers are missing, register them in the Providers UI and re-negotiate models.
- If providers show as disabled, check heartbeat errors and verify the provider endpoint.
- If no work is dispatched, check the Project Viewer for blocked beads, missing agents, or readiness gate failures.
- If beads are repeatedly dispatched without progress, check the dispatch hop count in the bead's context. The system will escalate to P0 after `max_hops` dispatches.
